This file keeps track of upgrades to the confeature module

Sometimes, changes between versions involve alterations to database structures and other major things that may break installations. The upgrade function in this file will attempt to perform all the necessary actions to upgrade your older installation to the current version. If there's something it cannot do itself, it will tell you what you need to do. The commands in here will all be database-\/neutral, using the functions defined in D\-L\-L libraries.

Library of interface functions and constants for module confeature

All the core Moodle functions, neeeded to allow the module to work integrated in Moodle should be placed here. All the confeature specific functions, needed to implement all the module logic, should go to \hyperlink{locallib_8php}{locallib.\-php}. This will help to save some memory when Moodle is performing actions across all modules.
