\subsection{Detailed Description}
Capability definitions for the confeature module

The capabilities are loaded into the database table when the module is installed or updated. Whenever the capability definitions are updated, the module version number should be bumped up.

The system has four possible values for a capability\-: C\-A\-P\-\_\-\-A\-L\-L\-O\-W, C\-A\-P\-\_\-\-P\-R\-E\-V\-E\-N\-T, C\-A\-P\-\_\-\-P\-R\-O\-H\-I\-B\-I\-T, and inherit (not set).

It is important that capability names are unique. The naming convention for capabilities that are specific to modules and blocks is as follows\-: \mbox{[}mod/block\mbox{]}/$<$plugin\-\_\-name$>$\-:$<$capabilityname$>$

component\-\_\-name should be the same as the directory name of the mod or block.

Core moodle capabilities are defined thus\-: moodle/$<$capabilityclass$>$\-:$<$capabilityname$>$

Examples\-: mod/forum\-:viewpost block/recent\-\_\-activity\-:view moodle/site\-:deleteuser

The variable name for the capability definitions array is \$capabilities

This file keeps track of upgrades to the confeature module

Sometimes, changes between versions involve alterations to database structures and other major things that may break installations. The upgrade function in this file will attempt to perform all the necessary actions to upgrade your older installation to the current version. If there's something it cannot do itself, it will tell you what you need to do. The commands in here will all be database-\/neutral, using the functions defined in D\-L\-L libraries.

Library of interface functions and constants for module confeature

All the core Moodle functions, neeeded to allow the module to work integrated in Moodle should be placed here. All the confeature specific functions, needed to implement all the module logic, should go to \hyperlink{locallib_8php}{locallib.\-php}. This will help to save some memory when Moodle is performing actions across all modules.
